Everyone has their unique alpha. Let's try to empower that.

How can we foresee Deepseek's potential impact on Nvidia before the market consensus is reached, as well as Alibaba's subsequent actions, and systematically maintain the exploration and quantification of Alpha?

Followers of the Alphaforest public account know that in an article titled "The Gray Rhino of 2025" published on January 1st, I mentioned the potential impact Deepseek could have on Nvidia (similarly, various issues such as U.S. bonds have also largely been validated). Then, in mid-January, during market panic, I clearly informed group members about the opportunity with Alibaba. (In fact, I also privately discussed this with a few members; it's estimated that Alibaba might quickly follow up in this area. Moreover, Alibaba was evidently undervalued before). There is actually another industry this year that is likely to hit a turning point, but I'll keep that under wraps for now.

Over the years, there have been quite a few discovered points (in fact, everyone has the potential to discover alpha, like how Peter Lynch's mother identified the business potential of Walmart before he did. When Luckin Coffee faced financial issues and was on the brink of delisting, its stock dropped below one dollar; if you observed, you'd find that its business was surprisingly okay. However, individual capability is limited, so what one can perceive is also limited, hence the need for some knowledgeable community power). But how can we systematically explore these? And how can we quantify the stage at which this information has reached? Then, how can we track the real-time changes in the win rates of various factors for the associated targets? This requires a mature system (a common principle: any good investment idea initially benefits those who recognize it first because others haven't noticed yet and the price is still at a discount. Then, when it enters the stage of public acceptance, the price begins to rise, and those who join in can still make money, but the returns are moderate. The highest risk stage is when the general public and media are hyping it daily, even those who usually don't pay attention start getting involved, believing that it's something great that will always rise, and at this stage, newcomers suffer huge losses).

Investing is a marathon; explosive returns are merely the result of everyone's research. If you have cutting-edge research tools and reliable risk management, everything else will follow naturally.

So, I want to take this opportunity to find those willing to invest time and effort in this area. Let's work together to develop tools and platforms, even spending out of our own pockets to buy some real-time data, build servers, and integrate them into our research pipeline.

In fact, the success of Deepseek and Whatsapp has shown us that, with a good idea, you don't need many people or a huge investment. As long as resources are appropriately allocated and the team working together is passionate, you can outperform those institutions (many organizations waste substantial resources on bureaucratic infighting, and if viewed as an algorithm, they are inherently inefficient).

 If you're interested in participating, you can visit the GitHub page at https://github.com/ForrestLi/Your_alpha_pipeline to join the discussion and share your ideas. By collaborating, you'll have the opportunity to work with like-minded individuals in developing and improving systematic exploration and quantification methods for investment opportunities. Hopefully, you'll be able to find suitable collaborators to help advance the project. If you have any specific questions or ideas, you can bring them up on the project's GitHub page for deeper discussion and collaboration.


如何在市场达成共识之前就预见到Deepseek可能对英伟达的冲击，以及阿里的后续行动，并且系统地保持对Alpha的挖掘与量化？

关注公众号Alphaforest的小伙伴们知道我在1月1日发表的《2025的灰犀牛》一文中就提到了Deepseek可能对英伟达的影响，（另外，美债之类的也基本应验了七七八八）。然后在1月中旬，当市场恐慌时，我明确告诉群里的小伙伴关于阿里的机会。（实际上也和几个小伙伴私下交流过，阿里接下来这块估计会蛮快跟进。而且之前阿里是显而易见的低估值）。今年其实还有一个行业很有可能会进入拐点，这就先卖关子。

这些年发现的点还挺多的。（其实每个人都有可以发掘的alpha，就像彼得·林奇的妈妈当年发现沃尔玛生意好，比他还更早知道相应机会。瑞幸当年财务问题要被退市，跌过一块的时候，你如果去观察就会发现，结果生意居然还不错。只不过个人力量有限，能看的东西也有限，所以需要部分懂行的群体力量）。但如何系统性地进行发掘呢？以及如何量化这个消息已经到了哪个阶段呢？然后如何跟踪相应标的不同因子实时胜率的变化呢？ 这就需要一个成熟的系统了。（普及一个常识，任何好投资理念，最初认识到的人当然是赚最多的，因为大家还没看到，价格仍处于折价阶段，然后当进入大众接受阶段，价格开始被抬高，入场的小伙伴们呢，也还是可以赚钱的，但是收益一般了。然后就是风险最高的阶段，那就是普罗大众和媒体都在天天炒作，完全平时不关注的人群也开始入圈，并且认为这个东西非常好，会永远上涨的阶段，这时候再来的小伙伴就会蒙受巨额亏损）。

投资就是一个马拉松，炸裂的收益只是大家研究之后的成果而已。如果有了前沿的研究工具，配合靠谱的风控，其他的自然而然就来了。

所以我想借这个机会，寻找一下愿意在这块投入时间、精力，大家一起研发搭好工具、平台，甚至自己掏钱买一些实时数据，搭服务器，放到研究流程中。

其实Deepseek，还有Whatsapp的成功就告诉了大家，只要有好的想法，不需要多少人，多大的投入，资源放到刀刃上，一起做事的人有激情，就可以超越那些机构（很多组织其实大量资源浪费在官僚扯皮上，如果看成一种算法，本来也是效率很低的）。
